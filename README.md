# [WIP] Procedural Worlds Editor

PWE is a node based procedural terrain generator which aims to support a complex biome system, multiple surface generation algorithms and an easy and powerful API to add anything you want to the generation.  
This asset generate fully procedurally worlds as standalone (like in minecraft), only scripts will generate the terrain and so manual terrain editing tool are not planed to be implemented.

In addition to unit-tests and codacy linter, there is also performance testing [available here](http://pwperfs.tk), it currently displays the process time of a graph for one chunk of 128\*128.
